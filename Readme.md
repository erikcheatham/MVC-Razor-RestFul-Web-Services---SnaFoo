README
======

This is a barebones project layout. Included with the project are a set
of static pages that you should use as a starting point for your page
views.  You do *NOT* need to go beyond what is shown in the static pages.
While not included in the solution, these can be found in the *statics*
folder.

Also included are some SQL scripts that you can use to set up a database
for your expected models. You may modify the database schema as you wish
but the intent is that it is sufficient to complete the NAT. **NOTE:** you
do *NOT* need to use the given schema (or scripts) if you don't want;
they are provided as a convenience to help reduce the amount of effort
in accomplishing the NAT.  These can be found in the *sql* folder.
